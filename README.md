# ShipSafe
###### ShipSafe was a 6 hour project submission for the 2022 McMaster Engineering Competition that received 1st place. This project simulates an Ad Hoc network of weather stations that delivers weather data. Using the tkinter class to create a graphical user interface, the user can view weather data such as temperature, wind speeds, UV, rain, pressure, and seismic activity. Standard deviations were used to simulate data based on average values set as a median. Furthermore, each value is highlighted by a certain colour, to quicky indicate good, moderate, or bad conditions.
